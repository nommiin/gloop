# Usage
instantiate the `gloop` class and provide your code as the first argument, then call the `Parse` method to parse your code and the `Run` method to run your code

# Syntax
### Types
- String: use double quotes to define a string
- Numbers: write any number, uses parseFloat internally
- Statements: surround operands in `{` and `}`

### Functions:
- **one bad**
  - Takes value to the right and pushes it to the stack
  
- **gloop**
  - Adds the top two values from the stack together and pushes the result to the stack
  
- **do what i yoinky**
  - Prints out the top value from the stack
  
- **two big splurgs**
  - Uses a statement and takes two operands and immediately adds them then pushes the result to the stack
  
- **three more yoinks**
  - Like the `two big splurgs` instruction, takes three operands and adds them together; pushing the result to the stack
  
- **gloop and a splurgy**
  - Ends the program execution at any point
